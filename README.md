# OctopiLaser

This is ALPHA level software, very incomplete and quite full of bugs.

A touch screen interface designed to control hobby type Laser engravers.<p>
This is essentially an overlay to the wonderful OctoPrint system that is very popular with hobby type 3D printers.

Hardware requirements:<br>
Raspberry Pi V3 or above.<br>
5" LCD monitor. Connected via HDMI to the Raspberry Pi.<br>
Developed to connect to a Marlin system controller. Not tested on anything else, but as long as it works with OctoPrint, it should work fine.

READ THIS:<br>
LASERS ARE DANGEROUS.<br>
Lasers of any power can cause sudden blindness if the beam or a reflection strikes the eye.<br>
Use proper eye protection whenever working with any Laser system.<br>
The author of this software takes no responsibility for any harm, either to any living thing, or the laser equipment hardware.<br> 
Use at your own risk.
